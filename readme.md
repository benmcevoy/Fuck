# Fuck!

Ok.  You fucked up.  I fucked up.  It's all fucked.

## You fucked up

We all make mistakes, but I want you to know just how fucking stupid that mistake was.

`Fuck.YouFuckedUp(nameof(input), "I don't accept nulls, you fucking dumb arse")`

I want you to know that you fucked up when you pass values to me and I think they are shit.

Nope. Fuck off. `YouFuckedUp`.

## I fucked up

`Fuck.IFuckedUp("fuck man, I just work here")`

I'm not fucking perfect, ok.  And I'm going to let you know with an `IFuckedUp` exception.

## Fuck! Fucking! Fuck!

Oh shit. This is bad.

`Fuck.Fucking.Fuck("This is bad")`


## Oh. You serious.

Serious as fucking cancer.

`YouFuckedUp` is essentially the HTTP 40x.  If this was coding by contract it would be even better.

`YouFuckedUp` indicates bad input.

`IFuckedUp`, as unlikely as that is, indicates my code is pretty shit.  It's the HTTP 50x.

And when it's all gone wrong?

`Fuck.Fucking.Fuck("well fuckity fucking fuck. This is fucked.")`
